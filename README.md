## Please note 
The website must run locally however Its between deverlop part to prepict between Recyclable or diodradable.
## Project purposal
To create and develop the system to separate the waste by using Machine Leaning to read the picture of the waste.
The system model has classified into two significant parts. And minimize environmental pollution such as landfill or can better to cycle again.

## Data

## Building and Training the Model
As we can see the more training I've done. better of accuracy

# Conclusion 
This is the beginning of the machine leaning which can apply in so many sector. In order to making sinificant in waste system it need more accuracy and need more data to upload it in different shape and picture. Waste management system model is will help our human sesources to reduce pollution.

## Please note 
The website must run local http://127.0.0.1:5000/ however Its between deverlop part to prepict between Recyclable or diodradable.
## Introduction to run 
Download the fils or clone it
Open and run index.py via terminal 
Upload picture where you can see from upload
Please note Predictiction is still in processe.
## Thank you
